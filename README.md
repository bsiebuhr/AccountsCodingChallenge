# AccountsCodingChallenge
Frontier Accounts coding challenge - Bryan's version of code

Assumptions (derived from initial challenge)
1. Not enterprise level coding (stated explicitly in the challenge). This means that I did not worry about logging the query or building error handling
2. Time spent setting up for the challenge were not included in the 1-2 hour timebox specified

Tools used
1. Visual Studion Code - had to install this on my PC, along with NuGet package manager. My employer on my previous conttract supplied me with a laptop that had VS 2017, SQL server, etc. already installed.

Lessons learned
1. VS Code is quite a bit different than VS 2017 and it took some time to get things set up for an MVC project. I did not include my learning curve with this tool in the 1-2 hour timebox limitation

Still to do within the cocde
1. Is uses the included data factory, not the URL at the web service
2. Migrate final HTML to inlude Bootstrap responsiveness regaring varying display size
